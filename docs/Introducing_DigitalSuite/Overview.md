### Integrate. Automate. Co-Create.

RunMyProcess DigitalSuite is the basis for end-to-end solutions tailored to customer needs. It enables organizations to:

**Integrate** - the complete digital supply chain by connecting digital processes, systems, and devices with each other and with the people who use them, independent of their location. A comprehensive library of pre-built connectors is available to link on-premise systems like SAP and Oracle, cloud applications like Salesfores or Office 365, or enterprise directories like LDAP and Active Directory. Advanced API management capabilities allow for the quick development of additional connectors and the integration of almost any digital service or system as well as IoT edge technology.

**Automate** - processes and workflows across the enterprise and beyond. With user-friendly tools, drag & drop design, and low-code development, users can compile automated workflows of any complexity, including parallel processing, for every business area. They can manage the workflows and interact with them from any device and location. Secure connections, end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and other security mechanisms ensure that the data and communication is safe at any time and in any place.

**Co-create** - new business models and enterprise solutions that revolutionize change and transform business. Intuitive interfaces and ecosystem capabilities enable all stakeholders to participate in the innovation process and share their expertise, resources, and assets. With APIs that wrap existing systems, implement business logic, or orchestrate people, systems, and devices, users can create sustainable applications and value chains and connect them to new digital worlds.

**Secure** - RunMyProcess DigitalSuite and the applications running on it are hosted in highly secure data centers around the globe operated by Amazon Web Services. Customer data is not duplicated or stored in these data centers, but only retrieved at run-time and retained as long as required for processing in workflows and applications. RunMyProcess DigitalSuite provides for secure access to data in a variety of on-premise customer systems, ranging from file systems to relational databases and SAP. All communication, from web and mobile apps to cloud and internal systems, is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. Data at rest in the data centers - such as configuration or process data - is encrypted with customer-specific, asymmetric keys. The connection and login processes are designed to withstand brute force attacks.

**Protect** - RunMyProcess DigitalSuite is a multi-tenant platform built from the ground to keep each customer's data private within a shared technical and operational environment. All access is authenticated and authorized, so that customers cannot get hold of resources that do not belong to them. Multiple authentication schemes are supported, including the use of existing enterprise directories such as LDAP or Active Directory with SAML and OAuth2 for single sign-on. Customers can model organizational structures of any complexity to reflect the way their business works. They can create roles and assign access rights as required to enable highly granular control over access to all platform, application, process, and task resources.

**Trust** - Based in the EU, RunMyProcess DigitalSuite operates under a world leading data protection regime to foster trust and ensure that customers benefit from the highest security standards. Customers retain the sole responsibility and ownership for any data they process using RunMyProcess DigitalSuite. Only a strictly limited subset of RunMyProcess support personnel have the ability to access the production servers and log files. New releases and fixes are applied to the platform in a continuous way, security and vulnerability issues being addressed with the highest priority. Well established resource distribution, redundancy, and disaster recovery mechanisms enable non-stop operation and business continuity for customers, even during updates of the platform.

##  Users of RunMyProcess DigitalSuite

RunMyProcess DigitalSuite is a multi-tenant platform built to keep its customers' data private within a shared environment. Each registered customer corresponds to a tenant and has a unique **account**. Customer accounts can be configured as required, for example, to use specific authentication methods or dedicated homepages for different devices.

Customers can register **users** to their account as needed. They can assign the users a standard User or Administrator profile, and define user metadata and preference settings of their choice in addition to the pre-configured ones.

For access control at project level, customers can define any number of **roles** and assign them to users as required. A role represents a set of responsibilities for a user and the access rights to take the corresponding actions. In order to reflect the structure of responsibilities, roles can be arranged in role hierarchies and grouped in organizations as needed by each customer and the individual projects.

Users can log in to RunMyProcess DigitalSuite from anywhere in the world and use desktop or mobile devices to work with the applications implemented on it. After a successful login, the users are forwarded to a web page specified in the customer account settings and have access to tools, applications, and assets as defined by their roles.
